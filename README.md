# Taz Wanted Modding Tool
Original source code belongs to **[MuxaJlbl4 (MuLLlaH9!)](https://github.com/MuxaJlbl4)**.

This software is designed for decrypting and (in the future) unpacking & encrypting Taz: Wanted game files.

Planned:
- Adding automation for decrypting bmps and gifs.
- Adding a basic interface for unpacking, decrypting, encrypting and for different platforms (Windows, PS2, Xbox, GCN).
- Adding quickbms directly to the program and automate the collection of output files.
- Adding SoX/VGMToolbox to support decryption of sounds and music within the application.
- Add decrypting of text files directly in the application.
- Adding texture decrypting from PS2, Xbox and GCN.
